1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.				/// This is a method called randomNumber \\\

2. Prompt player to "Pick a number between 1 and 100."		***Only use int values***

3. If player enters a number outside of this range display message "Your guess is not between 1 and 100, please try again."   *** Start while loop / if statement  ***

  3a. Invalid input should not affect the number of guesses the player has left.		*** Use continue to keep loop moving and not use up guesses ***

4. If player enters a valid guess then display messages below:

  4a. If number guessed is lower than random number "Please pick a higher number."		*** Use else if to generate pick higher num response ***

  4b. If number guessed is higher than random number "Please pick a lower number."		*** Use else to generate pick lower num response ***

  4c. If number guessed is the random number "You win!"						*** Use if statement to follow invalid input, close scanner, use return to break loop ***

5. Player gets 5 chances to guess the random number.						*** Set numGuesses to 5  ***
	
6. If they haven't guessed the random number after 5 tries, game is over and display message "You lose, the number to guess was theRandomNumber."  Where theRandomNumberis the
   actual value of the random number generated at the begining of the game.			*** Reduce the numGuesses by one after each guess "numGuesses--" also close scanner at end of app ***

7. The game is over and the app ends once the user fails to guess the random number or they correctly guess the random number.
